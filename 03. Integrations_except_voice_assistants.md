| Compromise via servers such as Mosquitto visible on public network | Verified source and destination of the network connection | Check and confirm if any of the servers are visible on internet |

| Compromise via APIs that allow access to servers / home assistants over public network | Verified source and destination of the network connection | Check documentation of the integration to confirm if any APIs allow access to servers / home assistants over public network |
|                           |                         |
| Lateral movement and compromise via lack of authentication on the integration | Authentication before authorisation | Check documentation of the integration to confirm it has authentication for users  |
