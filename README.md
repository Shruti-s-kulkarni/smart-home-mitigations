# smart-home-mitigations

This repo lists the threats for smart home environments, the risk of materialisation of which can be reduced by smart home owners by applying the recommended mitigations.

The mitigations are mapped to zero trust policies. 

**Please note that the zero trust policies in this case cannot be as detailed and granular as in IT environment, because of the disparity in the devices.**
