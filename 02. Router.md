| Unauthorised connections to open ports | Session based connection from the router to the destination asset | Because not all destinations are known to a smart home owner and web applications connect over port 443, close unwanted ports on the router such as 21, 22, 25 |
|                           |
| Unauthorised connections to open ports | Authenticated connections | Port 7547 is used by ISPs for remote administration. If the ISP does not use any authentication for the connection, any malicious actor can discover this port and try and access the admin console. So close port 7547  |
