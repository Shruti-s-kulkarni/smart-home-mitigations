## This file provides high level, technology agnostic information about zero trust policies

**Before starting on the policies, users are adviced to understand the below mentioned terminologies and definitions**

Zero trust is a security strategy that aims to reduce the presence of implicit trust in an environment, such that breaches can be reduced.\ 
Breaches take place because resources of value exist in an environment. Resources provide required functionality. Entities access resources to either consume the offered functionality or to carry out a business process. In this mix is access control and authentication. With authentication an entity proves who they are or who it is. With access control, an entity accesses the resource with the allocated permissions and privileges. Permissions are granted to an entity if there is a need for the entity to access the resource. Privileges are the granular activities that an entity can carry out with the resource.\
Breaches take place if permissions and privileges are not granted correctly or if the entity is not authenticated before access is granted. This is because a malicous actor could be masquerading as the entity. A malicious actor masquerades as an authenticated entity because the environment implicitely trusts the entity as it has provided authentication credentials at some point in time.\
To reduce implicit trust, the entity needs to be authenticated before granting access to the resource.\
Authentication before authorisation is challenging in a smart home environment because of:\
&nbsp; &nbsp;  a. Devices manufactured with different protocols by various vendors\
&nbsp; &nbsp; b. Reduced access requests by humans than devices\
&nbsp; &nbsp; c. Nuances of device-to-device authentication and authorisation

With such complextities and little exposure to how authentication and authorisation processes of and between the devices, the following zero trust policies can be adopted about handling the various asset categories in the environments.

1. Need to know basis: Need to know basis is a security construct. This construct guides people on who their information should be shared with, and more importantly who it should not be shared with. For example a credit card owner would not want to share the 16 digit card number, the expiry date and the CVV with anybody who asks for them. The same concept holds true in the digital world as well. Owners of the credit card should exercise caution and share the details only where required. If there is no need to share the details with a voice assistant, please do not do it.
   
2. Least privilege: Least privilege is a security connstruct. This construct guides people in ensuring that only the required permissions and privileges are for a device or a person to carry out activities. For example if there is no need for a smart fridge to connect with an integration, delete the connection.
   
3. Authentication before authorisation: This principle ensures that details of a device, its metadata or its settings are not shared without knowing who the entity is. This principle applies to devices / settings / network vectors such as SSID, near-field activation PINs. For example hide SSID from external unknown actors. 

4. Comprehensive visibility: Use this principle to obtain as much information as possible about a device and an egress connection.

5. Verified source and destination: In an IT / OT / IoT world this policy would be applicable to firewall rules (which has source, destination, protocol and port), an identity allowed to access a resource, the type of device, health of device, type of API call, etc. However in the context of a smart home environment this policy can be applied on routers to ensure that only known and secure ports are enabled, the endpoints of APIs are verified before enabling them on the environment. This policy is also applicable for integrations and their visibility, as any integration that has public network visibility would be visible to a malicious actor.

6. Hashed credentials: Credentials (passwords, keys, etc.) must not be stored in clear text. This is because it defeats the very purpose of having authentication. Anybody who has access to the system can go look up the credentials and connect to the system. Encrypted credentials are alright too... but before purchasing any device or integration check if credentials are stored in clear text.
